The original Parking Lot Manager prototype developed by EasyParkPlus provided basic functionality but exhibited several design flaws that limited its maintainability and extensibility. The goal of this refactoring effort was to identify and remove poor design practices, apply appropriate object-oriented design patterns, and restructure the system to support future growth, including Electric Vehicle (EV) charging and multi-facility operations.
This section outlines the key issues identified in the original codebase, the fixes applied, and the rationale behind the selected design patterns.


In conclusion the refactoring effort transformed the original Parking Lot Manager prototype into a cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible system. By removing design anti-patterns and applying the Factory and Strategy patterns, the system now adheres to core object-oriented principles and is well-positioned for future growth. The applied fixes represent meaningful architectural improvements that directly address the shortcomings of the original codebase.
